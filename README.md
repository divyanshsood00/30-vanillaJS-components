# üñºÔ∏è 30 Days of UI ‚Äî Micro Frontend Projects
[Live link](url)

A collection of **30 bite-sized UI/UX projects** built from scratch to practice front-end development and interaction design.

I challenged myself to create **one new interactive UI component or mini-project every day** and share it on LinkedIn. The goal was to **improve my JavaScript, CSS, and UI design skills** while building a public portfolio of creative, reusable components.

Each project is **small, focused, and interactive**, ranging from loaders and animations to fully functional widgets like login forms, sliders, and draggable elements.
